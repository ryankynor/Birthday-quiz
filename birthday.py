2. The name of the month they were born in (e.g. "September").
3. The year they were born in (e.g. "1962").
4. The day they were born on (e.g. "11").

If the user's birthday fell on October 31, then respond with:

  You were born on Halloween!

Otherwise respond with a statement like this:

  Peter, you are a winter baby of the nineties.
